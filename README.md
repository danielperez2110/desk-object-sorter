# Desk Object Sorter

## Overview
This project uses Google’s Teachable Machine to create a machine learning model that can recognize common objects in my bedroom. The purpose is to learn the fundamentals of supervised image classification, including collecting and labeling training data, training and testing a model, iterating and refining, understanding bias in AI, and exporting and managing models with GitHub.

## Classes My Model Will Recognize
- PS4 Controller
- PlayStation
- iPad
- Nintendo Switch
- Keys
- Wallet
- Phone
